- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @duck-sec
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in security, and bread.
- I have too many different repos, I'm slowly trying to centralise them all here.
- Any code posted here is provided for educational purposes as well as for use in legitimate, AUTHORISED, security testing ONLY.
- All code is provied "as is" with no support. Please use carefully at your own risk.
