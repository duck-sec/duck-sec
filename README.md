- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @duck-sec
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in security, and bread.
- I have too many different repos, I'm slowly trying to centralise them all here.
- Any code posted here is provided for educational purposes as well as for use in legitimate, AUTHORISED, security testing ONLY.

duck-sec/duck-sec is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
